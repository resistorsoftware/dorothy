title: There's a Mouse in the House

I have a cat. He is a nice cat. Everyone thinks he looks swell. A real champion. Possibly a Norwegian Forest Cat. Wow. Sounds great. For a little while now he has been keeping a close eye on the fridge, and the stove, which site pretty much across from each other in the Kitchen. Why is he always sitting there watching the appliances?

Then last night, my wife tells me that as she was slaving over the stove and cooking something, she saw a small grey mouse out of the corner of her eyes make a made dash from underneath the fridge to underneath the stove. Gadzooks! Where was the danged cat! Isn't the whole point of having a cat around to keep a house mouse-free. A rodent-less zone. 

He is clearly out of his element here. I am open to suggestions as to how to deal with this problem. Something easy and effective to trap the little buggers and ensure don't have then underfoot anymore.
