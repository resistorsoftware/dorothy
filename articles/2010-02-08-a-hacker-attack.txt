title: A Hacker Attack
date: 2010/08/01

Once upon a time...my friend installed phpmyadmin to look at mysql databases. Unfortunately, that codebase comes with a weakness whereby a hacker can get the config file config.inc.php and wire up a connection to control the server. What a pile o'crap that is. Oh well, lesson learned.
